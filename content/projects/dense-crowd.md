Implemented architecture that counts the total crowd in the dense crowd images using deep and shallow convolutional neural network Deep CNN helped to count near the part of the image where the density of the crowd is very high and shallow CNN helped in detecting the persons who are completely visible (where the complete body was visible). This method could detect up to 80% accuracy where the actual count in the image is approximately as high as 4000
